# Portfolio

This portfolio site will house an about me section (most likey the landing page), an experience section, a projects section (where I will be able to upload projects and save them to the database without having to hard-code in the links and information), and a JS playground where I can house my experiments with JS functions (and any other language). 

First job is to get this back end up and running as my API, with mongo as my db on heroku (also utilizing mLab). Then, I can start accessing the backend db while creating my front-end react app. This eliminates some unnecessary coding on the front end if the API isn't already set up correctly.
